This is a text File
This file will be used to illustrate how to read files using Node.js fs module and how to serve it up to the browser

Q6: You can make the type of file mutable. Using the word after the '.' to check whether it is a image like jpg
or text like txt.

Q7:  To have both you could have the same code into the case statements. Having the default case read the url
and based off of the type of content then try to run the correct case. If its jpg, run code for a jpg type, if
txt, run code for text type. If a request, run code for running that request function.
